      When I was blocked in a simple problem:
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      I was codeing for the task "Gradebook" and my code kep sending back error "testScores undefined".I kept on going back to the whole code again and again but it was of no help. I tried to console.log almost line by line but even that did not help. Then I googled it for common errors and then bang...it was case error as I was referring to it as "testscores" but actually it was "testScore". In this exercise (at a different point) I also asked for help on discord. This taught me to first have a thorough look at the error for any case or spelling error before doubting about the code.

      When I elegantly solved a problem:

    <p id="answer">
      In the "FizzBuzz" task for the first part in which we had to check for the divisibilty with 3, 5 and both combined after initial hiccups(not doing the divisibilty test in the given sequence) I was able to successfully run the test that involved manupulating an array.

      Reflect on how confident you feel using problem-solving techniques/processes:

    <p id="answer">
      A single problem solving technique is not going to solve all the problems. Many a time even after googling it is difficult to follow so you need somebody to explain it in a more simple way and at that point we need peers/coaches. So I am still in the learning phase of problem/solving and trying to experiment/adapt with all the methods that can guide me to a solution.
