      <p id="question">
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      One of the first things we went though in core learning was about the value and identity. This was the part that I haven't had the opprtunity to reflect much since it seemed as part of the experinces I have gained till now and it was no big deal. This activity gave me the opprunity to apppreceite what values I have develped over time.<br><br>
      The second part of core learning made me reflect on the things that I need to work on.<br><br>
      And finally it also taught me to approach a challenge by breaking it into smaller pieces and not to get overwhelmed by the challenges.

    <p id="question">
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      IIt is always good to know about your capabilities, limitations and how far they can be stretched. This prepares us to approacha a problem in a more planned way. Values and empathy play a very important role in our interactions with work collegues as well as any other social interaction.

    <p id="question">
      What has surprised you the most about the core learning?

    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      When I started writing about the core answers inially I would hesitate and didnt know where to start but now it has become more of an interactive kind of thing and have almost started enjoying penning them down!

    <p id="question">
      What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      The most challenging aspect of core learning was to self - analyse and reflect. One is generally used to hearing about ourselves from others.

    <p id="question">
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      There are many avenues for gaining technical skills but one develops soft skill/core skills generally by interacting with others. So this foundation part of the course gave us a platform to interact with other fellow students and our facilitators. This helps in shaping the personality of the students when they are in the job market.

    <p id="question">
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming?
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      Core learning did not feel like waste of time because it made me understand about myself and how to approach a problem.
