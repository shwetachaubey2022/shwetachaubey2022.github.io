      <p id="question">
        What is Emotional Intelligence?
    </p>
    <p id="answer">

    </p>

    <p id="question">
      How is it different to IQ?
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      In a very general term if we were to explain IQ then it would be measured as the ability of one's brain to respond in a certain way. IQ measures the logic and reasoning for a response whereas EQ is more of human instinct measured by awareness, understanding and control of emotions.
      
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      Why is it important?
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      For measuring the intelligence of a person IQ plays a very vital role but when we talk about the social aspects of one's ability to interact with amother person then EQ can be given more importance. For instance, if someone says something that is not a perfect answer then to respond to that answer with a staight 'no' might not be a very balanced response. Instead one can think and devise a way to respond so that the other person doesn't feel bad about it and yet one is able to correct.
