    <p id="question">
      <br>What is your long term goal or career pathway?
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      My long term goal is to become full stack software developer or test analyst. I want to be confident in programming and want to combine that with core learning from this course to enhance my prospects of job search in IT.

    </p>

    <p id="question">
      What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?    
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      My strongest attribute is curiosity that helps me take up challenges. I never get bogged down by difficult situations and instead love to work through them to resolve it. I think this is the strength of my personality. <br><br>

      I feel that sometimes I get too involved and lose track of time. Even if I am doing something else my brain would keep looking for the solution till the problem is resolved.<br><br>

      Eventhough I use discord to solve my problems I am not very active so I would try and improve on that so that others feel I am there. Also, I feel , I am a little hesitant in the begining and then I become alright after a while. Its like I take time to settledown!!

    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      Since I would like to be in the software market, I feel that sometimes it might get stressfull so I would like to polish my core skills to be the best fit in the field.

    <p id="question">
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      I think being dedicated would automatically instill a sense of punctuality and commitment which in turn would provide motivation to stay a step ahead. Some times I could be in tricky situations but I would take a break and try to stop thinking about it. 
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      The very first thing I do when I need help is to look up at discord to see if anyone else has face the same issue and till now that has always worked. Next best would be to google and if that too doesnt work then open a thread and ask for guidance on discord.
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team. 
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      I would reach out to the facilitator if I have not been able to resolve/understand by other means so I expect the facilitator to guide me solve the problem. I would also love to get feedback from the facilitator on all the aspects(technical and core) of my learning journey.
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      I do have commitments towards my 8yrs old daughter but I have planned it in advance. Hopefully things should workout and I wouldn't be required during the course. If anything comes up then I would make sure to inform the facilitator.
