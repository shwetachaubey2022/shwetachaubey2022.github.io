    <p id="question">
      What is your long term goal or career pathway?
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      My long term goal is to become full stack software developer. I have had some knowledge of 
      programming and I want to combine that with this course to enhance my skills. This will
      enable me to join a team of developers and pursue my goal.
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.    
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      My strongest attribute are curiosity that helps me take up challenges. I never get bogged down by 
      difficult situations and instead love to work through them to resolve it. I think this is 
      the strength of my personality. 
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      I feel that sometimes I get too involved and lose track of time. Even if I am doing something else my
       brain would keep looking for the solution till the problem is resolved. 
    </p>
    
    <p id="question">
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      Since I would like to be in the software market, I feel that sometimes it might get 
      stressfull so I would like to polish my core skills to be the best fit in the field.
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      I think being dedicated would automatically instill a sense of punctuality and commitment which in 
      turn would provide motivation to stay a step ahead. Some times I could be in tricky situations but 
      I would take a break and try to stop thinking about it. 
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      The very first thing I do when I need help is to look up at discord to see if anyone else 
      has face the same issue and till now that has always worked. Next best would be to google 
      and if that too doesnt work then open a thread and ask for guidance on discord.
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team. 
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      I would reach out to the facilitator if I have not been able to resolve/understand by 
      other means so I expect the facilitator to guide me solve the problem. I would also love
      to get feedback from the facilitator on all the aspects(technical and core) of my 
      learning journey.
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
      For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to 
      plan these in.
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      I do have commitments towards my 8yrs old daughter but I have planned it in advance.
      Hopefully things should workout and I wouldn't be required during the course. If anything 
      comes up then I would make sure to inform the facilitator. 
    </p>
