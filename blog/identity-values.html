    <p id="pOne"><i>It has been a really long time when I last sat and pondered over this.
      This topic gave me an opportunity to reflect over some of the abstract things aquired by me over the time. 
      In the answers below I have tried to be honest and just in reviewing my personality.
    </i></p>

    <p id="question">
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
      the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      Once, back in India, an employee working for our client was starting his own setup 
      while still being employed with them. The person enquired if we could provide him 
      consultancy services. Even though it was an opportunity to grow our business yet I
      declined the offer politely as it was unethical to get engaged with the person directly
      while he was still employed with our client.

    <p id="question">
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      I am an avid learner and never shy away from learning new things. I believe this strength of 
      mine would support me in this journey. I do not hesitate in asking for help if I get stuck. 
      I am of the belief that that if soemthing is new for you then there are chances you would get
      stuck and thats perfectly alright. Just as we have saying that
      " you will not learn to ride a bicycle if you do not fall and get hurt".
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. 
      How might these affect your learning journey?
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      As my facilitator said "whenever you are struggling, do a worst job".
      I would like to follow this to move forward rather than getting stuck at one place and wasting time. 
      So I can be an explorer but also need to focus on skill demonstration simultaneously. I have 
      to understand that I can not be perfect in one shot. Being perfect requires tons of practice 
      as the saying goes "practice makes a man perfect".(I wonder why not woman) I would also like to work on
      my writing skills to express myself better as sometimes I thinks too much before writing. I feel that it should come naturally.

    <p id="question">
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
      Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections 
      on what other strategies you would try now and why.
    </p>
    <p id="answer">
      Once there was disagreement with the client on the total number of hours spent on a particular project. 
      The client was not willing to approve the invoice. So I had to first coordinate and collect individual hours spent by each 
      team member and then I arranged a video meeting. I put forth my views supported with the
      documents I had collected and finally the client was convinced. When I look back and think,
      I feel,  probably even now, I would handle such a situation the similar way.
