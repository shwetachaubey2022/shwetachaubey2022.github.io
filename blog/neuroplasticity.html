      <p id="question">
        Research Neuroplasticity
    </p>
    <p id="answer">Earlier doctors thought that brain stopped developing/growing after a certain age. But new research suggests that our brain never stops growing. Its the use or not use of it that makes the difference . And here we talk about neuroplasticity of the brain. Neuroplasticity plays a vital role in helping us acquire new skills, increases memory and it aids in recovery from traumatic brain injuries and strokes. 
    </p>

    <p id="answer">In my case it would benefit me in concentrating and learning new things with an increase in memory and brain volume. Some of the ways to increase neuroplasticity is to medidate, do yoga, take up challenging games/brain activities and of course do some physical excercise.
